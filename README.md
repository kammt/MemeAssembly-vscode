# memeassembly-vscode

Work in progress. Currently provides snippets and syntax highlighting.

See [vsc-extension-quickstart.md](vsc-extension-quickstart.md) on how to use. 

TL;DR: Clone, open in VSCode; then press F5 to start VSCode with this extension for debugging

### TODO
* Syntax highlighting for "x units are ready, with x more well on the way" doesn't seem to work
